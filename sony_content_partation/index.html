            <p>Being a market leader in the headphones category, Sony India was not really concerned about only growing market share. They wanted to grow the market. The challenge was "How do we get music lovers to demand better sound quality from their audio devices?"<p>
            
            <div class="challenge_text"><img src="images/target.png"></div>
            <p>The core TG was music lovers. People who were listening to music on the go. Through their phones, mp3 players, laptops, car speakers etc. This is largely the segment we called the “Play List Generation”. People for whom having a particular song on their play list was more important than how it really sounded of their inferior audio devices. They were people who 
        accepted inferior quality audio as a part of life.</p>

  <p>  Two iconic musicians – Shreya Ghoshal and Kailash Kher – came together to create a brand new song “Naina Chaar”. 
Their artistic process was broadcast through 9 Webisodes, where they interacted and collaborated with their fans. 
Through the journey, the artists showed how much effort goes into making every note perfect, <br>

and why good quality equipment is needed to truly experience music. </p>
<br>

<p><strong>Finally, their journey culminated into an online concert where the new song was unveiled.</strong>
